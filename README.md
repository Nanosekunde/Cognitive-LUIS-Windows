 LUIS
==============
LUIS is a service for language understanding that provides intent classification and entity extraction.
In order to use the SDK you first need to create and publish an app on www.luis.ai where you will get your Application Id and Subscription Key.

The solution contains the SDK and a sample application that allows you to enter your appId and appKey, and to perform the two actions "predict" and "reply".
